- Flask-powered **web application** with:  
  - Mobile responsive UI  
  - Dark/Light theme toggle

## âš¡ How It Works
1. The **tags column** of books is vectorized using `CountVectorizer` (max 2000 features, stopwords removed).  
2. Pairwise **Cosine Similarity** is computed between all books.  
3. The **top-N most similar books** are recommended for each query.  
4. The similarity matrix and dataset are stored in a pickle file for reuse.
